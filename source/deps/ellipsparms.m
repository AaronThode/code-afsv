%ELLIPSPARMS  Calculates parameters of bivariate normal ellipse from covariance.
%   [AREA,A,B,ANG] = ELLIPSPARMS(S,CRITVAL,MD,VM) where
% S is the covariance matrix,
% CRITVAL is the critical value from the chi-squared distribution,
% MD is the mean position of the DASAR array,
% VM is the estimated location. 
% It returns 
%   AREA of the ellipse, 
%   A and B are lengths of major and minor full axes respectively, and 
% ANG is angle in radians ccw of  major semi-axis.
%   The angle is referenced to an imaginary vector emanating from the center of the
%   DASAR array and directed toward the estimated location.
%   Note: index matrices using vec representation.
% ANGAX is angle in radians of major axis measured ccw from +X axis
%
% The adjustments to ANG (last set of if/then statements) reflect the
%   angle of the major axis 180 degrees about the ray directed from MD to
%   VM (if necessary) so that the major axis is always directed away from
%   MD.  The absolute orientation of the ellipse is unchanged; only its
%   "direction" relative to the center of the DASAR array may be adjusted.
